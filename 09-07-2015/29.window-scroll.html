				The div is only there to make the height of the window tall enough to allow it to scroll. If you make it position:fixed, the height of the window will no longer be tall enough to have a scrollbar, thus not allowing you to scroll. And, if you can't scroll, the event will not fire. Here's a modified fiddle with a fixed div within it.
